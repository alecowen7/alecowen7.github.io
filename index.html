        <p>I am a first year student at <a href="https://www.osu.edu" target="_blank" >The Ohio State University</a>
        
        , where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering. My passions include sports, 
        specifically basketball and volleyball. I am also an avid supporter of Ohio State athletics and my hometown Phoenix 
        Suns. Acadmically, my passions lie in mathematics, computer programming, and efficiency of systems. I hope to use 
        these skills to give back to others in my communities and make an impact on the world.</p>
