        , where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering. I was raised in Scottsdale, 
        Arizona in a family of five. This includes my twin older brothers, Connor and Bryce, my parents Tom and 
        Joni, and my dog AZ (the sixth member). My passions include sports; I enjoy playing basketball and 
        volleyball, and supporting Ohio State athletics and my hometown Phoenix Suns. In the classroom, I enjoy 
        learning about mathematics, computer programming, and efficiency of systems. I hope to use these skills 
        to give back to others in my communities and make an impact on the world.</p>
